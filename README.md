# COMP_354_ASQ Setup

Note: This version of ETERNITY is not the final product, but there are still some bugs with the functionality of the calculator running with a GUI. We have chosen to use this text-based calculator to be a part of the ASQ, since its functionality won't be different than a GUI-based calculator.

To run the program:

1. Make sure you have a copy of the `MyProject.jar` file on your computer, preferably in a directory on your desktop (or another directory if you prefer).
2. In your terminal, `cd` into the directory where you have the `MyProject.jar` file.
3. Once you are in the directory, run the command `java -jar MyProject.jar`

The app should be running.
